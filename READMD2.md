The [South Coast Air Quality Management District](https://www.enveraconsulting.com/what-is-the-scaqmd/) is the local regulatory agency for most of Southern California.

As part of their core function, the AQMD ensures that all stationary sources of air emissions comply with all of the applicable rules.  This includes various state, federal and local air pollution control rules/regulations.

The AQMD has various programs in place to ensure that stationary sources comply with all applicable regulations.  These include:

* Air quality permitting
* Implementation of the Federal Title V program
* Regional Clean Air Market Incentives (RECLAIM) program
* Compliance inspections

The AQMD has more than 25,000 facilities under their jurisdiction.

## The Inspection Process

During the inspection process, an inspector will show up to a given facility and look at the equipment, permits, and records that the facility may have.  In general, the inspector is there to verify that all conditions are being met and rule compliance is being achieved. 

In the event if the inspector finds issues of non-compliance, they can take one of two actions.

First, they can issue a notice to comply (NTC), which is effectively like a fix-it-ticket.  To resolve an NTC, the facility will need to make the proper adjustments as noted by the inspector and notify the AQMD that the changes have been made. There isn't a fine associated with a notice to comply.

Second, they can issue a notice of violation.  Notices of violations 
 (NOV) are not serious than an NTC, and can include heavy fines and legal action. Depending on the situation, the fines issued by the AQMD can be up to $1 million per day per violation. 

## Project Overview

As part of this project, we sought to cluster, using k-means, more than 3,500 NOV issued by the AQMD over the XXXX - XXXX timeframe. 

By clustering the data, we sought to find patterns or natural groupings in the dataset that may not be apparent from just looking at the data on its face. The identification of clusters in the data can be used by our customers in order better understand the most common regulations that the AQMD issues violations for. 

The data for this project was obtained via web scraping of the AQMD's website.

The general approach for this project included the following steps:

* Developing the business problem
* Obtain the data
* Clean/pre-process the data
* Creating initial plots of the data
* Clustering the data using k-means
* Plotting the data
* Analyzing results
* Discussion the results

As a whole, this project can be considered to be an end-to-end project since it involved the entire data analysis workflow. 

## Key Take Aways

From a review of the top 100 tokens from each of the four types of facilities, you can see that the distrubution of the tokens in each faciliyty type, generally makes sense.
